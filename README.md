## Introduction

Welcome to my SQL and RStudio Portfolio! This repository showcases various projects and scripts that highlight my growing skills in SQL and RStudio. Here, you will find examples of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, demonstrating my ability to work with structured data and uncover actionable insights.
