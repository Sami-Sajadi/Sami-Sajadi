## Introduction
This project analyzes the performance of cryptocurrency portfolios over a year using historical price data. By leveraging RStudio, the project evaluates returns, portfolio value, risks, and correlations to simulate investment strategies. Key calculations include Return on Investment (ROI), daily returns, portfolio performance over time, maximum drawdown, and correlation between portfolios.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Tools Used**:
  - RStudio for data analysis and visualization.
  - Libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyverse`.

- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Calculating ROI for individual cryptocurrencies.
  - Computing daily returns and portfolio values over time.
  - Measuring risk (standard deviation) and correlations between assets.
  - Simulating portfolio performance with varying allocations.

## Key Features

- **Portfolio ROI**: Determined ROI for individual cryptocurrencies and portfolios.
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculated standard deviation to measure the risk of each portfolio.
- **Daily Returns**: Analyzed daily returns for assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored correlations between Bitcoin and other assets to understand diversification benefits.
- **Drawdown Analysis**: Identified maximum drawdowns for each portfolio, showing periods of peak-to-trough losses.
- **Simulations**: Evaluated portfolio performance under different investment allocations.
